        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <strong>scrambled it</strong> to make a type <br>
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
        
        <h2 id="2">Where does it come from?</h2>
        <h5>There are many variations of passages</h5>
            
        <p>If you are going to use a <strong>passage of Lorem Ipsum</strong>, you need to be sure there isn't <br>
             anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators <br>
             on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first <br>
             true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined</p>

        <h2 id="3">Why do we use it?</h2>
        <h5>It is a long established fact</h5>
            
        <p>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of <br>
             letters, as opposed to using <em>'Content here, content here'</em>, making it look like readable <br>
              English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as <br>
             their default model text, and a search for</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="4">Where can I get some?</h2>
        <h5>There are many variations of passages</h5>
                 
        <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, <br>
             making this the first true generator on the Internet. <strong>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin </strong> <br>
             words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which <br>
             looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected <br>
              humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
