            <p>
                I come from the kidnapped,
                <br>the assaulted––
                my country’ tis of <em>reparations</em> as in-store credit <!--em is curved-->
                                                   <br> backordered to bankruptcy
                
                It is me & my trophy wife<br>
                passing as a dream of some kind<br>
                
                All I want is 40 <strong>dead</strong> mules<br> <!--strong is bold-->
                & an acre of land w/ a lighthouse<br>
                            right above the porch of the great Atlantic Ocean<br>
                            just in case any of my ancestors tasted nasty & made it.<br>
